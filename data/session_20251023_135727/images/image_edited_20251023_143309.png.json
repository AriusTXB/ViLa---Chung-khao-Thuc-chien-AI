  "prompt": "**Bối cảnh:** A minimalist representation of a public space (e.g., a park bench, a bus stop, an open cafe area). The background is simplified with clean geometric shapes and soft, neutral colors, ensuring the characters are the focal point.\n**Syle:** Look exactly like the image I have given you, not the image you generated\n**Background**: On the bus and some other people is judging the man\n**Nhân vật:**\n1.  **Người đàn ông hút thuốc:** Positioned centrally or to one side, standing or sitting casually. He holds a lit cigarette, with stylized smoke curling vividly from it. His expression is neutral or unconcerned, emphasizing his lack of awareness or disregard for others. The smoke around him should be visually distinct – perhaps a thicker, greenish-gray haze that subtly spreads. Some what look like the man in the image below but fatter and wearing a shirt\n2.  **Người phụ nữ mang bầu:** Stands or sits a short distance away from the man, clearly showing a visible baby bump. Her body language conveys discomfort and distress. She is in the middle of a coughing fit, her hand perhaps covering her mouth or clutching her chest/stomach. Her face,shows clear signs of irritation and struggle.\n3.  **Thai nhi (Fetus):** **Crucial element.** Inside the pregnant woman's abdomen, an ethereal, semi-transparent outline of a developing fetus is visible. This fetus should also be depicted in a state of distress, with subtle stylized lines suggesting a cough or struggle for breath, possibly tiny bubbles or ripples around it representing discomfort from the inhaled smoke. It should glow faintly or have a different color tint (e.g., a vulnerable blue or sickly yellow) to emphasize its fragility.\n\n**Màu sắc:** A dominant palette of muted greens, cool grays, light blues for the background. The smoke should be a distinct, somewhat sickly gray-green. The pregnant woman and fetus might have slightly warmer or more vibrant colors to emphasize life, contrasted with the dullness of the smoke. The overall mood is cautionary and highlights an urgent health issue.\n\n**Cảm xúc & Thông điệp:** The composition should clearly illustrate the direct and immediate negative impact of secondhand smoke on vulnerable individuals. The invisible harm to the unborn child is made visible and impactful through the transparent fetus character. Focus on delivering a strong public health message about the dangers of smoking in public.\n```\nMake sure they are wearing shoes",
