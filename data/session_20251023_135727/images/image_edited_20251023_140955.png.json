  "prompt": "**Image Prompt: Educational Kurzgesagt Animation - The Hidden Cost of Alcohol**\n\n**Style:** Kurzgesagt inspired animation, likely to the image below.\n\n**Composition & Perspective:** A wide shot or medium-wide shot, effectively dividing the frame. The scene should feel like an internal glimpse into a fractured home. The viewer's eye should naturally gravitate between the two distinct groups.\n\n**Characters:**\n1.  **The Man:** Positioned to the left or right, standing somewhat isolated and separate from the rest of the room. He holds a single, stylized beer bottle. His posture is slightly slouched, and his head might be slightly downcast.You can only see his back with his hand holding the broken bottle of beer\n2.  **The Woman & Daughter:** Huddled in the opposite corner of the frame. The woman is the primary focus: her arms wrapped tightly around her young daughter, who is clinging to her. The woman's body is slightly hunched, suggesting shivering or fear. Large, stylized tears fall from her eyes, and her mouth might be a simple line downturned. Her expression is one of deep sorrow, fear, and helplessness. The daughter, equally stylized, peeks out with wide, scared eyes or has her face buried in her mother's shoulder, conveying extreme vulnerability.\n\n**Setting & Atmosphere:** A sparsely decorated, almost empty room, depicted with clean, geometric walls and floor. The background colors are predominantly somber: deep blues, dark purples, and cool grays. There are no distracting elements. The lighting is crucial: one side (near the man) might have a colder, almost clinical light, while the corner with the woman and child might be in deeper shadow, or lit by a faint, sorrowful glow, emphasizing their fragile state. The overall atmosphere is heavy, poignant, and silent, conveying a sense of profound unhappiness and the devastating ripple effects of alcohol.\n\n**Key Visual Elements:**\n*   **Contrast:** The physical and emotional distance between the man and his family.\n*   **Symbolism:** The single beer bottle as the focal point of the man's attention, contrasted with the despair of his family.\n*   **Emotional Impact:** The visible distress of the woman and child must be immediately clear, even with stylized characters.\n\n**Purpose:** To serve as a powerful educational image highlighting the negative, often silent, consequences of alcohol on family life and well-being.",
