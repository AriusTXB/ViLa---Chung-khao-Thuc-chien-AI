  "prompt": "**1. Alcohol & Accident (Foreground Left - Dominant & Impactful):**\n    *   **The \"Lure\" of the Bar:** A prominent alcohol bar structure, rendered with sharp, inviting neon signs (e.g., \"Quán nhậu\") glowing with warm, seductive oranges and reds. This light spills onto the wet asphalt, creating a deceptive glow.\n    *   **The \"Consequence\" - Motorbike Crash:** Directly adjacent to and slightly overlapping the bar's sphere of influence. Two highly stylized, mangled bikes (e.g., one flipped, one smashed front-on) are locked in a chaotic embrace on the road. Debris (small, geometric shards) is scattered. Flashing emergency lights (red/blue) from an unseen source (or implied by light pools) pulse across the scene, starkly contrasting with the bar's inviting glow. Overlapping speech bubbles (ghostly, transparent, or with a distressed symbol inside) could emerge from the crash site, symbolizing the cries for help or regret.\n\n**2. Drugs in the Shadows (Midground Right - Stealthy & Ominous):**\n    *   **The \"Veil\" of the Alley:** A narrow, deep alleyway that recedes into profound darkness, flanked by tall, featureless buildings. The entrance to the alley is just off the main road, visually separating it but hinting at its proximity.\n    *   **The \"Transaction\":** Two figures, one a slender teenager (identifiable by slight size difference or clothing cue) and another, larger, more ominous silhouette. Their hands are clasped briefly in exchange, highlighted by a sliver of sickly green or deep purple light that seems to emanate from within the alley itself. Small, abstract \"question mark\" or \"skull\" icons could subtly float near the drug exchange point, symbolizing danger and uncertainty.\n\n**3. Smoking & Illness (Background Center/Right - Lingering & Detached):**\n    *   **The \"Aftermath\" of the Ambulance:** A ambulance, with its rear doors ajar, positioned further down the road, yet still within the visual scope. The internal lights are dim, suggesting an intimate, enclosed space of medical attention.\n    *   **The \"Cycle\" of the Smoker:** A man's head and shoulders are slumped out of the ambulance's rear entrance. His face is pale, drawn, and etched with fatigue or ill health (thin lines, dark circles). A lit cigarette dangles from his fingers, with a faint wisp of smoke curling upwards, almost blending into the night sky but still present – symbolizing the continuous, self-inflicted harm even in a moment of vulnerability. Perhaps a subtle, transparent \"lung\" icon could be visible near his chest, hinting at internal damage.\n\n**Color Palette & Mood:** Predominantly deep, desaturated blues and grays for the urban backdrop, emphasizing the coldness and harshness of the city. Vibrant, yet conflicting, accent colors: the warm, alluring glow of the bar, the harsh emergency lights, the sickly green/purple of the drug deal, and the tiny, persistent red ember of the cigarette. The overall mood is one of stark reality, highlighting interconnected urban decay and the individual choices that contribute to collective suffering, all presented with Kurzgesagt's signature blend of scientific clarity and profound emotional undertone.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Mẹo để có kết quả tốt nhất:**\n\n*   **Sự phân chia không gian:** Đảm bảo ba thành phần được phân bố rõ ràng trong khung hình mà không làm người xem bị rối.\n*   **Liên kết không gian:** Dù các thành phần riêng biệt, hãy cố gắng tạo một dòng chảy thị giác kết nối chúng, có thể là ánh sáng, con đường, hoặc một chút khói.\n*   **Biểu tượng hóa:**việc sử dụng các biểu tượng nhỏ, rõ ràng (như biểu tượng rượu bia, gói thuốc, dấu hỏi) có thể rất hiệu quả.\n*   **Ánh sáng:** Ánh sáng đóng vai trò cực kỳ quan trọng trong việc tạo ra tâm trạng và hướng dẫn ánh mắt người xem đến các điểm nhấn.\nStyle: Semi realistic like the image I give you \nShowing how the society break down around this\nVietnamese heavy background, people filming the accident",
