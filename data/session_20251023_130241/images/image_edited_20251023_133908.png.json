  "prompt": "\"An emotionally charged and impactful propaganda poster-style illustration, depicting the devastating effects of alcohol abuse on a family unit. The scene is tense, emotionally violent, and visually fractured.\n    **Central Scene:** A dimly lit, cluttered living room or dining area, with clear signs of disarray.\n    **Characters:**\n    *   **Abusive Parent (Alcohol-affected):** A figure (can be male or female, appearing disheveled, flushed, and with angry or glazed eyes) stands aggressively, perhaps slamming a hand on a table, holding a half-empty glass or bottle of **alcohol (e.g., beer bottle, half-filled liquor glass)**. Their posture is dominant and intimidating, radiating anger and intoxication.\n    *   **Victimized Partner:** Opposite them, another adult (partner/spouse) is visibly heartbroken and defeated, recoiling or trying to shield a child. Their face shows deep sadness, fear, and hopelessness.\n    *   **Child Witness:** A young child (3-7 years old) is a prominent and central figure, cowering, perhaps with hands over their ears, or clutching onto the non-abusive parent, their small face filled with **terror and tears**. Their eyes are wide with fear, reflecting the parent's anger. The child's presence amplifies the tragedy.\n\n    **Elements:**\n    *   **Shattered Symbolism:** Abstract, visible cracks or fissures run across the walls, through a picture frame of a once-happy family photo hanging crookedly, or even metaphorically across the scene, symbolizing the breaking apart of the home and relationships. Broken glass (not necessarily from violence, but from carelessness) or an overturned chair might be in the foreground.\n    *   **Alcohol Paraphernalia:** Multiple empty or half-empty **beer bottles, wine glasses, or liquor bottles** are scattered on a table or the floor, emphasizing the chronic nature of the problem.\n    *   **Mess & Neglect:** The room itself shows signs of neglect and mess, adding to the atmosphere of a failing home.\n\n    **Lighting & Atmosphere:** The lighting is stark and dramatic, with harsh shadows highlighting the figures' tormented expressions. Colors are muted, desaturated, dominated by cold blues, grays, and sickly yellows, creating a somber and tense atmosphere. A sense of claustrophobia and inescapable dread.\n    **Mood:** Heartbreak, fear, domestic tension, emotional violence, destruction of family bonds.\n    **Style:** Propaganda poster art, raw, unflinching realism, highly detailed facial expressions and body language. Strong narrative composition. Focus on emotional impact rather than explicit physical violence, using fear and despair as key emotional drivers.\n    **Aspect Ratio:** Vertical composition (e.g., 2:3 or 9:16) to fit 1/3 of an A4 flyer.\n    **Purpose:** Educational, warning, impactful.\n    **Style: Like the image below\"",
