  "prompt": "\"A powerful, emotional illustration depicting the severe personal harm from drug addiction.\n    **Central Figure:** A gaunt, distressed young person (gender-neutral or ambiguous) is sitting huddled in a dark, isolated corner of a room. Their body language expresses extreme pain, struggle, and desperation â€“ perhaps clutching their head, trembling hands, or eyes filled with despair. Their skin is pale, hair disheveled.\n    **Elements:**\n    *   **Addiction/Withdrawal:** Faint, almost translucent chains or ropes are metaphorically wrapped around their body, symbolizing the grip of addiction and the struggle of withdrawal. Sweat beads on their forehead.\n    *   **Drug Paraphernalia (Subtle):** In the background, slightly out of focus or blurred, there might be a faint, overturned syringe or a small, empty pill container, not prominently displayed but hinting at the cause.\n    *   **Knife (Symbolic):** A *symbolic* knife, perhaps broken or dull, lies on the ground near their hand, not actively held in a self-harm pose, but representing the self-destructive thoughts, danger, or the \"cutting off\" of life and hope that addiction brings. *Crucially, it should not depict active self-harm or be overly graphic.* It implies a past dark moment or the ever-present danger.\n    **Environment:** The room is bare, cold, with muted, desaturated colors (grays, deep blues, hints of sickly green). Harsh, contrasting shadows. Minimal light, perhaps from a high window or a single, weak bulb, highlighting their suffering.\n    **Mood:** Extreme loneliness, despair, internal torment, physical and mental anguish.\n    **Style:** Modern emotional illustration, expressive brushstrokes, dramatic lighting. Avoid any glorification of drugs or overly graphic scenes.\"",
