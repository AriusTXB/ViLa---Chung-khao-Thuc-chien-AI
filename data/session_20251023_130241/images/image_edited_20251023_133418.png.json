  "prompt": "\"An extremely raw, unflinching, and impactful propaganda poster-style illustration depicting the devastating personal ruin of long-term drug addiction. The composition is vertical and cramped, emphasizing isolation and despair.\n\n    **Central Figure:** A severely emaciated young adult (gender-ambiguous, appearing gaunt, skeletal, and much older due to neglect and abuse) is huddled, cowering in a tight, dark corner of a dilapidated, filthy room. Their face is buried deep into their knees or hands, completely obscured, conveying utter defeat and shame. Their posture is curled and small, almost fetal, trembling subtly.\n\n    **Body Details:** On their exposed back (visible from the hunched posture or torn, dirty clothing), there are visible, graphic **self-harm scratches and older, scarred marks**, clearly indicating a history of self-inflicted wounds and internal torment. Large beads of **cold sweat** are visibly dripping down their neck, back, and forehead, suggesting intense withdrawal symptoms, feverish illness, or overwhelming anxiety.\n\n    **Background & Setting:** The room is plunged in oppressive darkness, with deep, stark shadows dominating. The walls are cracked, peeling, and stained with grime. A worn, rickety wooden chair stands ominously near the corner. Directly above this chair, from a dark, unseen ceiling, a crudely tied **noose (hangman's knot)** hangs down, starkly silhouetted against a slightly less dark patch of wall, casting a long, chilling shadow. This noose is a prominent and unmistakable symbol of suicidal ideation and the ultimate despair.\n\n    **Surrounding Objects:** On the dirty, debris-strewn floor, a small, crinkled plastic baggie containing a small amount of **white heroin powder** is carelessly discarded, half-spilled. Scattered around the heroin and other rubbish are several old, faded, torn, and wrinkled **family photographs** – showing happier times, smiling faces, a stark and heartbreaking contrast to the current scene. Some photos might be partially covered in dust or grime.\n\n    **Lighting & Atmosphere:** The lighting is dramatic and extremely low-key – almost entirely deep, oppressive shadows. A single, weak, cold light source (perhaps from a high, grimy window or a flickering, bare bulb, mostly off-frame) barely illuminates the edge of the scene, creating sharp, elongated shadows and highlighting the texture of the filth and despair. The overall atmosphere is one of profound hopelessness, isolation, and imminent danger.\n\n    **Style:** referenced image below\n    **Aspect Ratio:** Vertical composition (e.g., 2:3 or 9:16) to fit 1/3 of an A4 flyer.\n    **Purpose:** Educational, warning, impactful.\"",
